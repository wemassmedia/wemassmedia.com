[Natessa Martinez]({{ "/about/natessa-martinez" | absolute_url }}) currently serves as a member of our [Board of Directors]({{ "/about/board-of-directors" | absolute_url }}).

Natessa's journey began in the San Benito County Juvenile Hall as a mentor to incarcerated youth. Later, she became a licensed minister through the Assemblies of God and worked as a Youth Pastor at Sunnyslope Christian Center in Hollister, California.

Afterward, Natessa was led to missionary work with [Zimbabwe Orphan Care](http://www.zimorphancare.org/) (a Northern Ireland based NGO), founded and led by Pastor Alan Graham. Today, Natessa serves as a member of the board for Zimbabwe Orphan Care America.

Outside of also volunteering at other nonprofits, such as Spero Collaborative in Carmel, and the South Bay Coalition to End Human Trafficking, Natessa enjoys watching documentaries, hiking and camping (specifically, in the Santa Cruz mountains), traveling, and visiting coffee shops around America. She aspires to one day open a nonprofit coffee shop which employs individuals rescued from human trafficking. She also has a heart to adopt many children.
